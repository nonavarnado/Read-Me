# Hi there

I’m a graduate of UC Irvine’s School of Physical Science in the Earth System Science dept.  Before that I worked in nonprofit transportation advocacy, focused on geospatial data for decision making.

My primary research interest is in machine learning for atmospheric science. At UCI I participated in the Guenther Lab / 
<a href="https://bai.ess.uci.edu/">Biosphere Atmosphere Interactions (BAI) group</a>
 devoted to BVOC chemistry in modeling and field research.  I focused on gaining an understanding of edge issues in <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/117nnUMp_9kV3IbfEMjx2cawn__c-G_U3b4yKWfwtM7g/edit?usp=sharing"> aerosol physics</a></li> as they relate to Global Climate Models and atmospheric chemistry (AerChemMIP) modelling and focused on projections of increased BVOC emissions due to climate change in combination with future reductions in anthropogenic emissions.

TLDR: I'm passionate about using data science to explore real world environmental questions and happy to collaborate.
